# Basecone API
This is a Python client which can talk to the [Basecone API](http://developers.basecone.com/).

Used by me personally to download documents from Basecone and is not a official client in any way.

I use it to backup documents send to Basecone so that I also have a local copy of all data

# Running it
First, make sure you copy/create *config.py* which the right information.

Then run it:

<pre>./document-downloader.py</pre>

It will now store the output in *./downloads*
